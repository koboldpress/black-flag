The first time you fail an ability check while disarming a trap, opening a door, or passing a hazard, the failure doesn't trigger the trap, block the door, or force you into the hazard’s area—no consequence befalls you from the failure.</p></li><li><p>You have advantage on Perception and Investigation checks made to search for secret doors, find traps, and see through illusions.</p></li><li><p>You have advantage on saves made to avoid or resist traps or hazards. You are resistant to damage from traps and hazards.</p></li><li><p>When combat begins, you and allies within 5 feet of you can attempt a DEX (Stealth) check for the purpose of determining who is surprised.</p></li></ul>",
