      "value": "<p>Objects come to life at your command. Choose up to ten nonmagical objects within range that aren't being worn or carried. Medium targets count as two objects, Large targets count as four objects, and Huge targets count as eight objects. You can’t animate any object larger than Huge. Each target animates and becomes a creature under your control until the spell ends or until reduced to 0 HP.</p><p>As a bonus action, you can mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 500 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.</p><p>An animated object is a Construct with AC, hit points, attacks, STR, and DEX determined by its size. Its CON is 10 (+0), its INT and WIS are 3 (−4), and its CHA is 1 (−5). Its speed is 30 feet; if the object lacks legs or other appendages it can use for locomotion, it instead has a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover. If the object is securely attached to a surface or a larger object, such as a chain bolted to a wall, its speed is 0. It has tremorsense with a radius of 30 feet and is blind beyond that radius. When the animated object drops to 0 HP, it reverts to its original object form, and any remaining damage carries over to its original object form.</p><p>If you command an object to attack, it can make a single melee attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. It makes a Slam attack with an attack bonus and bludgeoning damage determined by its size. The GM might rule that a specific object inflicts slashing or piercing damage based on its form.</p><p><em>At Higher Circles.</em> If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th circle or higher, you can animate two additional objects for each slot above 5th.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.black-flag.rules.JournalEntry.PBo9j135EucIDliX.JournalEntryPage.TcFkvUlB0YTSTe4F inline]</p>",
