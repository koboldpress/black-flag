It loses any traits and abilities associated with its former lineage and gains any traits and abilities of the new lineage.</p></li><li><p>You can lower one of its ability scores by 2 (modifier decreases by −1) and increase a different ability score by 2 (modifier increases by +1), to a maximum of 20.</p></li><li><p>You give the creature birdlike or batlike wings. It gains a flying speed of 30 feet. Alternatively, you can remove its wings, which takes away an existing flying speed.</p></li></ul><p>You might be able to achieve a different effect of a similar kind with the permission of your GM.</p><p>A creature can be affected by this spell only once a year. If the spell is cast on it again before a year has passed, the casting fails.</p>",
