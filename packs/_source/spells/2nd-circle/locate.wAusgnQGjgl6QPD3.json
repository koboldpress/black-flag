If you cast this spell a second time, the first casting immediately ends.</p><p><em>At Higher Circles.</em> As you unlock higher circles, this ritual grows in potency. Once you have access to 4th-circle spell slots, you can use this spell to locate a specific creature or object that is familiar to you. In addition, the duration of this spell increases to concentration, up to 1 hour.</p>",
