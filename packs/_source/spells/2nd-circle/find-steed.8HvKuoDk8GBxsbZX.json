      "value": "<p>You summon a spirit that assumes the form of an unusually intelligent, strong, and loyal steed, creating a long-lasting bond with it. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the steed takes a form that you choose: <strong>warhorse</strong>, <strong>pony</strong>, <strong>camel</strong>, <strong>elk</strong>, or <strong>mastiff</strong>. (Your GM might allow other animals to be summoned as steeds.) The steed has the statistics of its chosen form, though it is a Celestial, Fey, or Fiend (your choice) instead of its normal type. However, if the form has an INT of 5 (−3) or lower, your steed’s INT becomes 6 (−2), and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak.</p><p>Your steed serves you as a mount, both in combat and out. You have an instinctive bond that allows you to fight together as a seamless unit. While mounted on your steed, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target your steed.</p><p>When the steed drops to 0 HP, it disappears, leaving no physical form. You can also dismiss your steed at any time as an action, causing it to disappear. In either case, casting this spell again summons the same steed, restored to its hit point maximum.</p><p>While your steed is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. You can’t have more than one steed bonded by this spell at a time. As an action, you can release the steed from its bond at any time, causing it to disappear.</p>",
