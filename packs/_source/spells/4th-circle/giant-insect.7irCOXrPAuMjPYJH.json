The GM has the statistics for these creatures and resolves their actions and movement.</p><p>A creature remains in its giant size for the duration, until it drops to 0 HP, or until you use an action to dismiss the effect on it.</p><p>The GM might allow you to choose different targets. For example, if you transform a bee, its giant version might have the same statistics as a giant wasp.</p>",
