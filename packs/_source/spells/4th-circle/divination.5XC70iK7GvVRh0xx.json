      "value": "<p>Your magic and an offering put you in contact with your deity or divine proxy. When you cast this spell, you can use it in one of the following ways:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Read the Future.</strong> You ask a single question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity to occur within 7 days. The GM offers a truthful reply. The reply might be a short phrase, a cryptic rhyme, or an omen. The spell doesn’t take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion.</p></li><li><p><strong>Read the Present.</strong> You ask up to three questions that can be answered with a yes or no. You must ask your questions before the spell ends. You receive a correct answer for each question. Divine beings aren’t necessarily omniscient, so you might receive <q>unclear</q> as an answer if a question pertains to information that lies beyond the deity’s knowledge or pertains to future events that have not yet transpired. In a case where a one-word answer could be misleading or contrary to the deity’s interests, the GM might offer a short phrase as an answer instead to provide needed clarification.</p></li></ul><p>If you cast the spell two or more times before finishing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting that you get no answer. The GM makes this roll in secret. If you receive no answer, you can’t attempt to cast this spell again until 24 hours have passed.</p>",
