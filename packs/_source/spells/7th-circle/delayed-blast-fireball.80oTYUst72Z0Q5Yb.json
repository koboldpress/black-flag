When the spell ends, either because your concentration is broken or because you decide to end it, the bead blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame that spreads around corners. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a [[/save]] save. A creature takes fire damage equal to the total accumulated damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><p>The spell’s base damage is [[/damage]]. If at the end of your turn the bead has not yet detonated, the damage increases by [[/damage 1d6 fire]]{1d6}.</p><p>If the glowing bead is touched before the interval has expired, the creature touching it must make a [[/save]] save. On a failed save, the spell ends immediately, causing the bead to erupt in flame.</p><p>On a successful save, the creature can throw the bead up to 40 feet. When it strikes a creature or a solid object, the spell ends, and the bead explodes.</p><p>The fire damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren’t being worn or carried.</p><p><em>At Higher Circles.</em> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th circle or higher, the base damage increases by [[/damage 1d6 fire]]{1d6} for each slot above 7th.</p>",
