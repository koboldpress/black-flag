The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action or cast this spell again.</p><p>If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else’s voice, a lion’s roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.</p><p>If you create an image of an object, such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest, it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The image can’t create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect.</p><p>Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion because things can pass through it.</p><p>If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful [[/check INT (Investigation)]] check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.</p>",
