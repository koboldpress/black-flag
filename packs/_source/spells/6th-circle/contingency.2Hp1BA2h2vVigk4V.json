      "value": "<p>Choose a spell of 5th circle or lower that you can cast, that has a casting time of 1 action, and that can target you. You cast that spell—called the contingent spell—as part of casting <em>contingency</em>, expending a spell slot for the contingent spell, but the contingent spell doesn’t come into effect. Instead, it takes effect when a certain circumstance occurs. You describe that circumstance when you cast the two spells. For example, a contingency cast with <em>water breathing</em> might stipulate that <em>water breathing</em> comes into effect when you are engulfed in water or a similar liquid.</p><p>The contingent spell takes effect immediately after the circumstance is met for the first time, whether or not you want it to, and then <em>contingency</em> ends.</p><p>The contingent spell takes effect only on you, even if it can normally target others. You can use only one <em>contingency</em> spell at a time. If you cast this spell again, the effect of another <em>contingency</em> spell on you ends.</p><p>Also, <em>contingency</em> ends on you if its material component is ever not on your person.</p>",
