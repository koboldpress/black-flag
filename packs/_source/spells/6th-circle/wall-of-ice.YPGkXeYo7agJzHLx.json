      "value": "<p>You create a wall of ice on a solid surface within range. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-square panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1 foot thick and lasts for the duration.</p><p>If the wall cuts through a creatureâ€™s space when it appears, the creature within its area is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice) and must make a [[/save]] save. On a failure, the creature takes [[/damage]] damage or half as much damage on a success.</p><p>The wall is an object that can be damaged and thus breached. It has AC 12 and 30 HP per 10-foot section, and it is vulnerable to fire damage. Reducing a 10-foot section of wall to 0 HP destroys it and leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall occupied. A creature moving through the sheet of frigid air for the first time on a turn must make a [[/save CON dc=@spellcasting.dc]] save. That creature takes [[/damage 5d6 cold]] damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><p><em>At Higher Circles.</em> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th circle or higher, the damage the wall deals when it appears increases by [[/damage 2d6 cold]]{2d6}, and the damage from passing through the sheet of frigid air increases by [[/damage 1d6 cold]]{1d6}, for each slot above 6th.</p>",
