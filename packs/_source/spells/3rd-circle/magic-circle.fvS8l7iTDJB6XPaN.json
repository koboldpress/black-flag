Glowing runes appear wherever the cylinder intersects with the floor or other surface.</p><p>Choose one or more of the following types of creatures: Celestials, Elementals, Fey, Fiends, or Undead. The circle affects a creature of the chosen type in the following ways:</p><ul><li><p>The creature can’t willingly enter the cylinder by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to do so, it must first succeed on a CHA save.</p></li><li><p>The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets within the cylinder.</p></li><li><p>Targets within the cylinder can’t be charmed, frightened, or possessed by the creature.</p></li></ul><p>When you cast this spell, you can elect to cause its magic to operate in the reverse direction, preventing a creature of the specified type from leaving the cylinder and protecting targets outside it.</p><p><em>At Higher Circles.</em> As you unlock higher circles, this ritual grows in potency. Once you have access to 4th-circle spell slots, the duration increases by 1 hour for each slot you have access to above 3rd.</p>",
