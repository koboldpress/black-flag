Metal corrodes from exposure to the dragons’ acid and the damp air. Paper soaks through and disintegrates. Wood bloats and warps. Enchanted items last longer, but they too ultimately succumb to corrosion. However, gems persist in the unfavorable environment, so black dragons collect as many as possible.

Powerful, intelligent, and cunning, their attacks rend armor, and their flaming breath devastates anyone foolish enough to stand against them. Older red dragons develop additional attacks and even the ability to cast spells.</em></p><p><strong>Avaricious and Territorial.</strong> Most dragons maintain hoards of gold, treasure, and magical items, but the greed of the red dragons is as legendary as their fire. They amass vast troves of wealth, preferring quantity over quality, and display trophies and skulls of slain foes prominently. Red dragons prefer to lair in volcanic caverns within mountains or subterranean areas of extreme heat. They surround their hoard chambers with twisting tunnels full of traps and guardians provided by the lesser creatures forced to serve them. Red dragons brook no incursions into their territory, which can stretch for miles around their lairs, and react to any perceived trespass with fury and fire.</p><p><strong>Dominating Pride.</strong> Red dragons truly believe they are the mightiest of all dragons and superior to all other creatures. They are quick to boast of their own greatness and happy to demonstrate their supremacy by fang or fire. This pride makes them tyrannical, and many red dragons delight in forcing tribute or service from lesser creatures.</p><p><strong>Incendiary Rage.</strong> The magical core of fire at the heart of every red dragon both generates their incinerating breath and makes them quick to anger. They take offense at even slight provocation, flying into devastating rages that last until their fury is vented.</p><h3>A Red Dragon's Lair</h3><p>A red dragon favors high mountains, claiming snowy peaks, fuming volcanoes, or sprawling ancient ruins. A red dragon’s immense strength, agile flight, and comfort in blistering temperatures make its lair difficult to traverse for most other creatures. From its skyward vantage point, a red dragon peers down at what it considers to be lesser kin. In the most extreme lairs, precariously maintained above the churning interior of active volcanoes, red dragons retain azers, fire elementals, fire giants, and devils or demons to serve their whims. Sprawling dwarven tunnels, forgotten giant foundries, or lakes of boiling stone make the perfect respite for a red dragon’s clutch or nest.</p><h4>Lair Actions</h4><p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), a red dragon can take one of the following lair actions. The dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Collapse.</strong> The ceiling on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it collapses, covering a 20-foot square area on the ground directly below that point. Each creature in that area must succeed on a [[/save dexterity 15]] save or be knocked prone and buried under the rubble. A buried creature is restrained and unable to breathe or stand up. A creature, including the buried creature, can take its action to free the buried creature by succeeding on a [[/save strength 15]] check while within reach of the buried creature.</p></li><li><p><strong>Swirling Ash.</strong> Searing ash blasts a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Each creature within 30 feet of that point must make a [[/save constitution 15]] save. On a failure, a creature takes [[/damage 3d6 fire average]] damage and is blinded until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t blinded. The ash ignites flammable objects within 30 feet of that point that aren’t being worn or carried.</p></li><li><p><strong>Conflagrate.</strong> One creature the dragon can see within 120 feet of it becomes tethered to the Elemental Plane of Fire. The target must succeed on a [[/save charisma 15]] save or be burned for 1 minute. While burned, the target takes [[/damage 2d6 fire average]] damage at the start of each of its turns. The effect ends early if the target takes cold damage, is submerged in water, or the burn is removed with a greater restoration spell or similar magic.</p></li></ul><h4>Regional Effects</h4><p>The region containing a red dragon’s lair is suffused with fiery chaos, which creates one or more of the following effects.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Acid Rain.</strong> Within 10 miles of the red dragon’s lair, precipitation is oily and stinks of sulfur. Snow in the area may be gray or black as it falls, appearing like ash, though its temperature is unchanged.</p></li><li><p><strong>Incited Rage.</strong> Creatures within 3 miles of the red dragon’s lair are quick to anger and slow to forgive. Such creatures have disadvantage on CHA checks, except CHA (Intimidation), and Beasts in the area that aren’t domesticated are more aggressive than normal.</p></li><li><p><strong>Unnatural Heat.</strong> Within 1 mile of the red dragon’s lair, temperatures are unnaturally high. Vegetation in the area withers and eventually crumbles to dust. Creatures in the area require twice as much water as normal each day to survive, and each creature in the area must succeed on a [[/save constitution 10]] save every hour it remains in the area or suffer one level of exhaustion. Creatures that are resistant or immune to fire damage are unaffected by this regional effect.</p></li></ul>"

Beneath its wide, bell-shaped cap, humanoid arms clutch ramshackle gardening instruments and crude weapons, while flat leg-stalks move the plant-creature toward any potential threats.</em></p><p>Mycolids sprout in areas infused with unnatural magical energy, such as the fetid bog of a black dragon, the cavernous ruins of the underworld, or the shady glade blessed by an archfey or druid. Regardless of region or climate, commoner myconids spend most of their lives cultivating a huge variety of mushrooms into a single unbroken chain of interconnected growth.</p><p><strong>Community First.</strong> They thrive in harsh environments without thought for shelter, culture, art, or history, and instead pour every moment of their relatively short lives into expanding the colony. Few creatures attack the peaceful fungal folk, but those that do find their woody bodies, soft, springy heads, and immunity to pain difficult to overcome. When a colony is threatened, every commoner mycolid fights to the death to protect the collective.</p><p><strong>Highly Toxic.</strong> Though commoner mycolids are safe to handle, creatures foolish enough to eat one may succumb to their potent toxins. In extreme situations, mycolids may let themselves be eaten to kill massive or dangerous creatures and add fertilizer to the colony. Mycolids spores are a powerful defense mechanism as well, and older mycolids have more powerful spores. Even newborn commoner mycolid spores can addle the mind of most beasts.</p><p><strong>Shared Memory.</strong> Each mycolid is a clone of a single progenitor called a spore lord. A family of like mycolids, the spawn of an individual spore lord, is called a “ring,” and each ring shares a collective pool of memories and consciousness connected to a mycelial network. As such, mycolids remember their own births as though they tended to their younger selves personally and can recall every birth and death since the ring began. Though all members of a ring look identical, no two rings are exactly alike. Separate rings cannot share thoughts or memories, but all mycolids can communicate telepathically over short distances.</p><p><strong>Spore Lord.</strong> When a safe area of rich, damp fertilizer can be secured, a commoner mycolid may undergo a rapid change into a more powerful form capable of using its spores to create a near-endless supply of identical offspring. This form, called a spore lord, does not rule over other mycolids. But while commoners tend to the health of mushrooms and mycolid sprouts, spore lords protect the colony from threats and supply it with a stream of clones. A single spore lord might create dozens or hundreds of clones of itself in its lifetime, and a dozen spore lords from different colonies may amass in a single fertile location without conflict.</p><p><strong>Magic Channelers.</strong> Upon transformation, a spore lord is made larger, stronger, and smarter by the primal magic that spawned it. Spore lords instinctively know how to manipulate the environment through cultivation and magic.</p><p><strong>Communal Knowledge.</strong> All members of a spore lord’s ring share its memories, but commoners lack the capacity to understand how and why the spore lord is different, though they recognize it. Only when separated from the colony can a commoner reach such an understanding, usually moments before it changes into a spore lord itself.</p>"

The apocalyptic fungus has no real intelligence, only a drive to reproduce. Humanoids can be infected by the fungus through contaminated food or water, breathing the spore clouds, or the bite of an infected host.</p><p><strong>Stages of Infection.</strong> Creatures infected by the apocalyptic fungus go through different stages of infection before they ultimately expire. Most die before reaching the final stage, though the fungus in their bodies continues to grow, dissolving the host’s remains. If the host body sustains serious damage or can no longer move easily, the fungus attempts to move into a dark, sheltered area so that, as the body decays, the fungus fruits and releases its spores. Sunlight kills the fungus and its spores.</p><p><strong>Skullblooms.</strong> Infected humanoids that succumb to the fungus become sporeborn skullblooms. Skullblooms show physical signs of their transformation, as the spores inside the host’s brain sprout into spongy stalks that break through the skull to crown the head, while patches of fungus break through the cheeks and around the eye sockets and random areas of the body. Skullblooms stalk or ambush victims and use cooperative tactics, such as herding potential victims toward other skullblooms lying in wait. Sometimes skullblooms enter periods of inertia, lying down or leaning up against a wall or tree and allowing the fungus to spread over them, only to burst out and attack when a potential target passes by.</p><p><strong>Bloatblossoms.</strong> Skullblooms eventually grow into bloatblossoms. A riot of fungal growth makes the body of these sporeborn broad and ungainly, with layers of tough, fibrous growth that protect it from damage. Bloatblossoms have better echolocation than the younger skullblooms, as well as nodules filled with mycotoxins that they can tear from their bodies and hurl at targets.</p>"

Occasionally, zombies are produced by other methods. Victims of wights, for example, often rise as zombies under command of the undead that killed them. Sometimes an enduring source of necromantic magic corrupts an area, causing nearby corpses to spontaneously rise as zombies.</p><p><strong>Decayed Corpses.</strong> The appearance of zombies varies widely, depending upon the condition of the corpse prior to animation. A corpse dead from natural causes and stolen from an undertaker may be well-preserved, if obviously not alive, while a zombie animated from a drowning victim is bloated and sagging. Some necromancers use whatever is at hand. Others may choose the most disgusting corpses to add an additional fear factor for those that must face the zombies in combat.</p><p><strong>Dim Intellect.</strong> Zombies have no personality and little intellect, following only the most basic commands. They can wield weapons if armed but simply batter an opponent with its limbs if not. They do not have the intellect to avoid even obvious hazards, shambling into open pits if they exist between them and a target or walking heedlessly through a fire to attack, unless commanded otherwise in that moment. When not under specific orders, a zombie simply stands awaiting commands, though if a living creature comes close enough for it to detect, it attacks, as the dark magics animating a zombie make it malicious toward the living.</p><p><strong>Non-Human Zombies.</strong> Zombies are most commonly animated human remains, but the flesh of any living thing can be animated as a zombie. Zombie giants, for example, would be stronger and harder to kill than a human zombie. They would attack like other zombies, though they could throw rocks like a living giant if commanded to do so. Non- humanoid zombies typically attack as they did when living. A zombie dragon, for example, would attack with claws and teeth, and it could still fly if its wings were intact.</p>"
