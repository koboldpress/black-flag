If the spell is on your circle’s spell list, you can read the scroll and cast its spell without providing any material components. Otherwise, it is unintelligible.</p><p>Casting the spell by reading the scroll requires the spell’s normal casting time. Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and it crumbles to dust. If the casting is interrupted, the scroll is not lost.</p><p>If the spell is on your circle’s spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must make a DC 17 ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. On a failed check, the spell disappears from the scroll with no other effect.</p><p>The spell ring determines the scroll’s rarity, save DC, attack bonus, and price.</p><p><strong>Save DC:</strong> 18</p><p><strong>Attack Bonus:</strong> +10</p><p>An arcane circle spell on a spell scroll can be copied just as spells in spellbooks can be copied. When a spell is copied from a spell scroll, the copier must succeed on an [[/check intelligence arcana 17]] check. If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, copying destroys the scroll.</p>",
