      "value": "<p>Inside this heavy cloth bag are [[/r 3d4]] dry beans. The bag weighs 1/2 pound plus 1/4 pound for each bean it contains.</p><p>If you dump the bag’s contents out on the ground, they explode in a 10-foot radius, extending from the beans. Each creature in the area, including you, must make a [[/save dc=15 DEX]], taking [[/damage 5d4 fire]] on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.</p><p>If you remove a bean from the bag, plant it in dirt or sand, and then water it, the bean produces an effect 1 minute later from the ground where it was planted. The GM can choose an effect from the following table, determine it randomly, or create an effect.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.black-flag.tables.RollTable.S3U8tAlPntofxTxb caption=false rollable]</p>",
