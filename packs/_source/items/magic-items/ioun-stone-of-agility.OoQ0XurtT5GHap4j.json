      "value": "<p>When you use an action to toss one of these stones into the air, the stone orbits your head at a distance of [[/r 1d3]] feet and confers a benefit to you. Thereafter, another creature must use an action to grasp or net the stone to separate it from you, either by making a successful attack roll against AC 24 or a successful [[/check 24 DEX (Acrobatics)]]. You can use an action to seize and stow the stone, ending its effect.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>A stone has AC 24, 10 HP, and resistance to all damage. It is considered an object that is also a carried item while it orbits your head.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Your DEX score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this deep red sphere orbits your head.</p>",
