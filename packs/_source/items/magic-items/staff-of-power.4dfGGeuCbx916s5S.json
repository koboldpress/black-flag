      "value": "<p>This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, you gain a +2 bonus to AC, saves, and spell attack rolls.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>The staff has 20 charges and regains [[/r 2d8 + 4]] expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff retains its +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls but loses all other properties. On a 20, the staff regains [[/r 1d8 + 2]] charges. The staff has the following additional properties:</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Power Strike. When you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can expend 1 charge as part of your Attack action to deal an extra [[/damage 1d6 force]] to the target.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Spells. While holding this staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spell attack bonus: cone of cold (5 charges), fireball (5th-circle version, 5 charges), globe of invulnerability (6 charges), greater hold (5 charges), levitate (2 charges), lightning bolt (5th-circle version, 5 charges), magic missile (1 charge), ray of enfeeblement (1 charge), or wall of force (5 charges).</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Retributive Strike. You can use an action to break the staff over your knee or against a solid surface, performing a retributive strike. The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>You have a 50 percent chance to instantly travel to a random plane of existence, avoiding the explosion. If you fail to avoid the effect, you take force damage equal to 16 Ã— the number of charges in the staff.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Every other creature in the area must make a [[/save 17 DEX]]. On a failed save, a creature takes an amount of damage based on how far away it is from the point of origin, as shown in the following table. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>TABLE</p>",
