Their properties are as follows:</p><ul><li><p>The <em>goat of traveling</em> can become a Large goat with the same statistics as a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.npcs.Actor.usBkwcEYxNPK7eXq]{riding horse}</strong>. It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in this form costs 1 charge. While it has charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a figurine and can’t be used again until 7 days have passed, when it regains all its charges.</p></li><li><p>The <em>goat of travail</em> becomes a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.npcs.Actor.X82CDCyHgR41wdQE]{giant goat}</strong> for up to 3 hours. Once it has been used, it can’t be used again until 30 days have passed.</p></li><li><p>The <em>goat of terror</em> becomes a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.black-flag.npcs.Actor.X82CDCyHgR41wdQE]{giant goat}</strong> for up to 3 hours. The goat can’t attack, but you can remove its horns and use them as weapons. One horn becomes a +1 lance, and the other becomes a +2 longsword. Removing a horn requires an action, and the weapons disappear and the horns return when the goat reverts to figurine form.</p><p>In addition, the goat radiates a 30-foot-radius aura of terror while you are riding it. Any creature hostile to you that starts its turn in the aura must succeed on a [[/save 15 WIS]] or be &amp;Reference[frightened] of the goat for 1 minute, or until the goat reverts to figurine form. The frightened creature can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it successfully saves against the effect, a creature is immune to the goat’s aura for the next 24 hours. Once the figurine has been used, it can’t be used again until 15 days have passed.</p></li></ul><aside><p>@Embed[Compendium.black-flag.rules.JournalEntry.zHvTHITijHvb07FK.JournalEntryPage.GgrjFmYmZW7aexLc inline]</p></aside>",
