      "value": "<p>This item first appears to be a Large sealed iron barrel weighing 500 pounds. The barrel has a hidden catch, which can be found with a successful DC 20 INT (Investigation) check. Releasing the catch unlocks a hatch at one end of the barrel, allowing two Medium or smaller creatures to crawl inside. Ten levers are set in a row at the far end, each in a neutral position, able to move either up or down. When certain levers are used, the apparatus transforms to resemble a giant lobster. See the Levers of the Apparatus table for what each lever does.</p>\n<p>The apparatus of the crab is a Large object with AC 20 and 200 HP.</p>",
