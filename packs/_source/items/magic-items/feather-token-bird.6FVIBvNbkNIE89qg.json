      "value": "<p>This Tiny object looks like a feather. You can use an action to toss the token 5 feet into the air. The token disappears and an enormous, multicolored bird takes its place. The bird has the statistics of a roc, but it obeys your simple commands and canâ€™t attack. It can carry up to 500 pounds while flying at a speed of 16 miles an hour or 1,000 pounds at half that speed (to a maximum of 144 miles per day, with a one-hour rest for every 3 hours of flying). The bird doesn't need to check for exhaustion, but it disappears after flying its maximum distance for a day or if it drops to 0 HP. You can dismiss the bird as an action.</p>",
