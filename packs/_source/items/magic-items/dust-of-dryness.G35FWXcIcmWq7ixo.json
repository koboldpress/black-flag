      "value": "<p>This small packet contains [[/r 1d6 + 4]] pinches of dust. You can use an action to sprinkle a pinch of it over water. The dust turns a cube of water 15 feet on a side into one marble-sized pellet, which floats or rests near where the dust was sprinkled. The pellet’s weight is negligible.</p>\n<p>A creature can use an action to smash the pellet against a hard surface, causing the pellet to shatter and release the water the dust absorbed. Doing so ends that pellet’s magic.</p>\n<p>An elemental composed mostly of water that is exposed to a pinch of the dust must make a [[/save 13 CON]], taking [[/damage 10d6 necrotic]] on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>",
