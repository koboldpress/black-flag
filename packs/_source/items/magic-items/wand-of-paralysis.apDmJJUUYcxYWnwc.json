      "value": "<p>This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cause a thin blue ray to streak from the tip toward a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a [[/save 15 CON]] or be paralyzed for 1 minute. At the end of each of the target’s turns, it can repeat the save, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The wand regains [[/r 1d6 + 1]] expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand’s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.</p>",
