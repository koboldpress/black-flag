      "value": "<p>When you use an action to toss one of these stones into the air, the stone orbits your head at a distance of [[/r 1d3]] feet and confers a benefit to you. Thereafter, another creature must use an action to grasp or net the stone to separate it from you, either by making a successful attack roll against AC 24 or a successful [[/check 24 DEX (Acrobatics)]]. You can use an action to seize and stow the stone, ending its effect.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>A stone has AC 24, 10 HP, and resistance to all damage. It is considered an object that is also a carried item while it orbits your head.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>You gain a +1 bonus to AC while this dusty rose prism orbits your head. Regeneration (Legendary, 50,000 gp). You regain 15 HP at the end of each hour this pearly white spindle orbits your head, provided that you have at least 1 HP.</p>",
