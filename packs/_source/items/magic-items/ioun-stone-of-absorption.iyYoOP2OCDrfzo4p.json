      "value": "<p>When you use an action to toss one of these stones into the air, the stone orbits your head at a distance of [[/r 1d3]] feet and confers a benefit to you. Thereafter, another creature must use an action to grasp or net the stone to separate it from you, either by making a successful attack roll against AC 24 or a successful [[/check 24 DEX (Acrobatics)]]. You can use an action to seize and stow the stone, ending its effect.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>A stone has AC 24, 10 HP, and resistance to all damage. It is considered an object that is also a carried item while it orbits your head.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>While this pale lavender ellipsoid orbits your head, you can use your reaction to cancel a spell of 4th circle or lower cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Once the stone has canceled 20 circles worth of spells, it burns out and turns dull gray, losing its magic. If you are targeted by a spell whose circle is higher than the number of spell rings the stone has left, the stone canâ€™t cancel it.</p>",
