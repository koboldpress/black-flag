      "value": "<p>While wearing this ring in dim light or darkness, as an action you can cast dancing lights and light from it. For its other properties, the ring has 6 charges.</p>\n<p>Faerie Fire. You can expend 1 charge as an action to cast faerie fire from the ring.</p>\n<p>Ball Lightning. You can expend 2 charges as an action to create one to four 3-foot-diameter spheres of lightning. The more spheres you create, the less power each sphere has.</p>\n<p>Each sphere appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet of you. The spheres last as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), up to 1 minute. Each sphere sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius. As a bonus action, you can move each sphere up to 30 feet, but no farther than 120 feet away from you. When a creature other than you comes within 5 feet of a sphere, the sphere discharges lightning at that creature and disappears. That creature must make a [[/save 15 DEX]]. On a failed save, the creature takes lightning damage based on the number of spheres you created.</p>\n<p>TABLE</p>\n<p>Shooting Stars. You can expend 1 to 3 charges as an action. For every charge you expend, you launch a glowing mote of light from the ring at a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Each creature within a 15-foot cube originating from that point is showered in sparks and must make a [[/save 15 DEX]], taking [[/damage 5d4 fire]] on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>\n<p>The ring regains [[/r 1d6]] expended charges daily at dawn.</p>",
