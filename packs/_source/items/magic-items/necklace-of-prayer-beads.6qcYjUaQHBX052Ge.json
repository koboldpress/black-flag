      "value": "<p>This necklace has [[/r 1d4 + 2]] magic beads made from aquamarine, black pearl, or topaz. It also has nonmagical beads made from stones such as amber, bloodstone, citrine, coral, jade, pearl, or quartz. If a magic bead is removed from the necklace, that bead loses its magic.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Six types of magic beads exist. The GM decides the type of each bead on the necklace or determines it randomly. A necklace can have more than one bead of the same type. To use one, you must be wearing the necklace. Each bead contains a spell that you can cast from it as a bonus action (using your spell save DC if necessary). Once a bead’s spell is cast, that bead can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>TABLE</p>",
