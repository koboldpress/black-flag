While you wear the robe, you gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>You can see in all directions, and you have advantage on WIS (Perception) checks that rely on sight.</p></li>\n<li><p>You have darkvision to a range of 120 feet.</p></li>\n<li><p>You can see invisible creatures and objects, as well as see into the Ethereal Plane, to a range of 120 feet.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The eyes on the robe canâ€™t be closed or averted. Although you can close or avert your own eyes, you are never considered to be doing so while wearing this robe.</p>\n\n<p>A light spell cast on the robe or a daylight spell cast within 5 feet of the robe causes you to be blinded for 1 minute. At the end of each of your turns, you can make a CON save (DC 11 for light or DC 15 for daylight), ending the blindness on a success.</p>",
