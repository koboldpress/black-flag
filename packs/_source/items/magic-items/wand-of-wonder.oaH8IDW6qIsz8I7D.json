      "value": "<p>This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges and choose a target within 120 feet of you. The target can be a creature, an object, or a point in space. Roll d100 and consult the following table to discover what happens.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>If the effect causes you to cast a spell from the wand, the spell’s save DC is 15. If the spell normally has a range expressed in feet, its range becomes 120 feet.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>If an effect covers an area, you must center the spell on and include the target. If an effect has multiple possible subjects, the GM randomly determines which ones are affected.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The wand regains [[/r 1d6 + 1]] expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand’s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into dust and is destroyed.</p>",
