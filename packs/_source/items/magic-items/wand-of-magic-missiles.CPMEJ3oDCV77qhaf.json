For 1 charge, you cast the 1st-circle version of the spell. You can increase the spell slot circle by one for each additional charge you expend.</p>\n<p>The wand regains [[/r 1d6 + 1]] expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wandâ€™s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.</p>",
