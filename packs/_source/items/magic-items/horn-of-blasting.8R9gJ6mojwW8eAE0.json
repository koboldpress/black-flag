      "value": "<p>You can use an action to speak the horn’s command word and then blow the horn, which emits a thunderous blast in a 30-foot cone that is audible to 600 feet. Each creature in the cone must make a [[/save 15 CON]]. On a failed save, a creature takes [[/damage 5d6 thunder]] and is deafened for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t deafened. Creatures and objects made of glass or crystal have disadvantage on the saves and take [[/damage 10d6 thunder]] instead of [[/r 5d6]].</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Each use of the horn’s magic has a 20 percent chance of causing the horn to explode. The explosion deals [[/damage 10d6 fire]] to the blower and destroys the horn.</p>",
