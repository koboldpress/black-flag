      "value": "<p>You must have proficiency with instruments (woodwinds) to use these pipes. They have 3 charges. You can use an action to play them and expend 1 charge to create an eerie, spellbinding tune. Each creature within 30 feet of you that hears you play must succeed on a [[/save 15 WIS]] or become frightened of you for 1 minute. If you wish, all creatures in the area that arenâ€™t hostile toward you automatically succeed on the save. A creature that fails the save can repeat it at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds on its save is immune to the effect of these pipes for 24 hours. The pipes regain [[/r 1d3]] expended charges daily at dawn.</p>",
