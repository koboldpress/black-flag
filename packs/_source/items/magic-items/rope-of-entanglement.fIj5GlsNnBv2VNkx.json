      "value": "<p>This rope is 30 feet long and weighs 3 pounds. If you hold one end of the rope and use an action to speak its command word, the other end darts forward to entangle a creature you can see within 20 feet of you. The target must succeed on a [[/save 15 DEX]] or become restrained.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>You can release the creature by using a bonus action to speak a second command word. A target restrained by the rope can use an action to make a DC 15 STR or DEX check (targetâ€™s choice). On a success, the creature is no longer restrained by the rope.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The rope has AC 20 and 20 HP. It regains 1 HP every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 HP. If the rope drops to 0 HP, it is destroyed.</p>",
