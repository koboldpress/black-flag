While wearing the ring, you can use an action to expend 1 to 3 of its charges to make a ranged spell attack against one creature or object that isn’t being carried within 60 feet of you. The ring produces a spectral ram’s head and makes its attack roll with a +7 bonus. On a hit, for each charge you spend, the target takes [[/damage 2d10 force]] and is pushed 5 feet away from you.</p>",
