To decipher and use the manual, you must be a spellcaster with at least two 5th-circle spell slots. A creature that canâ€™t use a manual of golems and attempts to read it takes [[/damage 6d6 psychic]].</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>To create a golem, you must spend 120 days, working without interruption with the manual at hand and resting no more than 8 hours per day. You must also pay the specified cost to purchase supplies.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Once you finish creating the golem, the book is consumed in flames. The golem becomes animate when the ashes of the manual are sprinkled on it. It is under your control, and it understands and obeys your spoken commands.</p>",
