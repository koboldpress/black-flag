If a creature belonging to the type associated with an arrow of slaying takes damage from the arrow, the creature must make a [[/save 17 CON]], taking an extra [[/damage 6d10 piercing]] on a failed save, or half as much extra damage on a successful one.</p>\n<p>Once an arrow of slaying deals its extra damage to a creature, it becomes a nonmagical arrow.</p>\n<p>Ammunition of this type exists for other weapons, such as bolts of slaying meant for a crossbow, though arrows are most common.</p>",
