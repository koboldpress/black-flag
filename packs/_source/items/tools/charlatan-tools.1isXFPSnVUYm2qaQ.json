      "value": "<p>Charlatan tools are used to craft disguises and forge documents.</p><p><em><strong>Associated Abilities:</strong></em> DEX, CHA.</p><p><em><strong>Components.</strong></em> This tool kit includes hair dyes, small props, cosmetics, a few choice articles of clothing, a selection of wax seals, gold and silver leaf, inks, a variety of parchments, and sculpting tools to fashion melted wax into seals or prosthetics.</p><p><em><strong>Create Disguise.</strong></em> Over the course of an hour (which can be done as part of a rest) you can create a disguise to make yourself or someone else—including any clothing or equipment—look like a different creature. A disguise can make a creature seem slightly taller, shorter, fatter, or thinner, but can’t conceal true size or basic arrangement of limbs. It takes 1 minute to don such a disguise once created. A set of charlatan tools only has enough materials to create one disguise at a time, but you can disassemble a disguise to create a new disguise as part of the time spent making a disguise. A creature can use its action to inspect a disguised appearance, and must succeed on an INT (Investigation) contest versus your DEX (Charlatan Tools) to discern a disguise.</p><p><em><strong>Forge Documents.</strong></em> Over the course of one hour (which can be done as part of a rest) you can create a simple false document of 5 pages or less—like a personal letter, a party invitation, or a sales permit. With the GM’s permission you can create longer or more complicated documents over the course of several hours or days. A creature can use its action to inspect a forged document, and must succeed on an INT (Investigation) contest versus your DEX (Charlatan Tools) check to discern a forgery.</p>",
