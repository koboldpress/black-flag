When you do so, the object’s AC increases by an amount equal to your PB or creatures have disadvantage on STR (Athletics) checks made to penetrate the fortification (the GM decides which is more relevant). An item doesn’t receive additional benefits from multiple attempts to fortify it.</p><p><em><strong>Build Cover.</strong></em> You can spend 1 hour (which can be done as part of a long rest) erecting a 5-foot by 5-foot wall panel in an unoccupied space, provided you have the raw materials to do so. The panel provides three-quarters cover for one Medium or smaller creature, and it can’t be moved. A panel of cover created with this feature is an object with an AC equal to 10 + your PB and 15 HP if made of wood or 25 HP if made of stone. It is immune to psychic and poison damage.</p><p><em><strong>Craft Items.</strong></em> Construction tools can be used to make items with the crafting downtime activity.</p>",
