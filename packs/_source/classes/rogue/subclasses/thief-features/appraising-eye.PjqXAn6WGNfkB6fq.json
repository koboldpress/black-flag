      "value": "<p>You’ve developed an eye for quality. As an action, you can inspect any object within 10 feet of you that you can see to learn whether it is nonmagical or magical. If the object is nonmagical, you immediately learn its approximate value in gold pieces. You also learn whether the object is fake or could conceal other objects inside it (though you don’t learn whether it is currently concealing objects or what those objects are).</p><p>If the object is magical, you can spend 1 minute examining it to learn its type, rarity, whether it is cursed, and if it requires attunement (and any specific attunement requirements it has). After you have examined a magic item in this way, you learn how to use it and can ignore any class or feature requirements that would normally prevent you from using it (though you still must abide by any level restrictions). If a magic item requires the use of a spellcasting ability, use your DEX to determine your spell save DC or spell attack bonus.</p>",
