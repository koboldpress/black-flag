If you already have a climbing speed when you gain this feature, it increases by 10 feet.</p><p>In addition, when you make a long jump, you cover a number of feet equal to your walking speed if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap half your walking speed. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement. In the event a STR (Athletics) check is required to clear or extend a jump, you can choose to make a DEX (Acrobatics) check instead.</p>",
