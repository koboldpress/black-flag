If you are successful, the trap is disarmed and not triggered. If you are unsuccessful, the trap is triggered as normal.</p><p>In addition, you can now disarm any magical traps that would typically require the use of the @UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.t61I6zrmEDPdOLfw]{dispel magic} spell. When you do so, make an ability check using only your DEX modifier, without adding any other modifiers to the roll. If the result meets or exceeds the trap’s DC (your GM has this number), it is disarmed as if you had successfully cast the dispel magic spell.</p>",
