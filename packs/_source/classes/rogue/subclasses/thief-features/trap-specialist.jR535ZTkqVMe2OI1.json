If you are successful, the trap is disarmed and not triggered. If you are unsuccessful, the trap is triggered as normal.</p><p>In addition, you can now disarm any magical traps that would typically require the use of the @UUID[Compendium.black-flag.spells.Item.t61I6zrmEDPdOLfw]{dispel magic} spell. When you do so, make an ability check using only your DEX modifier, without adding any other modifiers to the roll. If the result meets or exceeds the trapâ€™s DC (your GM has this number), it is disarmed as if you had successfully cast the dispel magic spell.</p>",
