      "value": "<p>As a conduit for arcane power, you can cast Arcane spells.</p><h6>Cantrips</h6><p>At 1st level, choose three cantrips from the Arcane spell list to learn. You choose more Arcane cantrips to learn at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the <strong>Sorcerer Progression</strong> table.</p><h6>Casting Spells</h6><p>You know a small number of spells and can cast any of them by using an Arcane spell slot of the spellâ€™s circle or higher. You don't need to prepare spells ahead of time.</p><p>The <strong>Sorcerer Progression</strong> table shows how many spells you know and how many Arcane spell slots you have at a given level. For example, at 3rd level, you have four 1st-circle slots and two 2nd-circle slots. If you know the 1st-circle spell <em>magic missile</em> and have a 1st-circle and a 2nd-circle spell slot available, you can cast <em>magic missile</em> using either slot. If you use a 1st-circle slot, you have three 1st-circle slots remaining.</p><p>You regain all used spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><h6>Spells Known of 1st Circle and Higher</h6><p>At 1st level, choose two 1st-circle spells from the Arcane spell list to learn.</p><p>The Spells Known column of the <strong>Sorcerer Progression</strong> table shows when you learn additional Arcane spells. Each spell you choose must be from a circle for which you have Arcane spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level as a sorcerer, you can learn one new Arcane spell of 1st or 2nd circle.</p><p>In addition, when you gain a level of sorcerer, you can choose one Arcane spell you know and replace it with another spell of your choice from the Arcane spell list. The replacement spell must be of a circle for which you have Arcane spell slots.</p><h6>Spellcasting Ability</h6><p>Charisma (CHA) is your spellcasting ability. Your CHA modifier determines the save DC or the attack modifier for certain spells you cast:</p><p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus (PB) + your CHA modifier</p><p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus (PB) + your CHA modifier</p><h6>Spellcasting Focus</h6><p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your Arcane spells.</p>",
