      "value": "<p>Your eldritch power deepens, giving you the ability to cast Wyrd spells.</p><h6>Cantrips</h6><p>At 2nd level, choose two cantrips from the Wyrd spell list to learn. You choose more Wyrd cantrips to learn at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the <strong>Warlock Progression</strong> table.</p><h6>Casting Spells</h6><p>You know a small number of spells and can cast any of them by using a Wyrd spell slot of the spellâ€™s circle or higher. You don't need to prepare spells ahead of time.</p><p>The <strong>Warlock Progression</strong> table shows how many spells you know and how many spell slots you have per day at a given level. For example, at 5th level, you have four 1st- circle slots and two 2nd-circle slots. If you know the 1st-circle spell <em>bane</em> and have a 1st-circle and a 2nd-circle spell slot available, you can cast <em>bane</em> using either slot. If you use a 1st-circle slot, you have three 1st-circle slots remaining.</p><p>You regain all used spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><h6>Spells Known of 1st-Circle and Higher</h6><p>At 2nd level, choose two 1st-circle spells from the Wyrd spell list to learn.</p><p>The Spells Known column of the <strong>Warlock Progression</strong> table shows when you learn additional Wyrd spells. Each spell you choose must be from a circle for which you have Wyrd spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level as a warlock, you can learn one new Wyrd spell of 1st or 2nd circle.</p><p>In addition, when you gain a level of warlock, you can choose one Wyrd spell you know and replace it with another spell of your choice from the Wyrd spell list. The replacement spell must be of a circle for which you have Wyrd spell slots.</p><h6>Spellcasting Ability</h6><p>Charisma (CHA) is your spellcasting ability. Your CHA modifier determines the save DC or the attack modifier for certain spells you cast:</p><p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus (PB) + your CHA modifier</p><p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus (PB) + your CHA modifier</p><h6>Spellcasting Focus</h6><p>You can use a wyrd focus as a spellcasting focus for your Wyrd spells.</p>",
