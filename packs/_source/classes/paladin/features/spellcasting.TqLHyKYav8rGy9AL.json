      "value": "<p>At 2nd level, you enhance your martial prowess with the ability to cast Divine spells.</p><h6>Casting Spells</h6><p>You know a small number of spells and can cast any of them by using a Divine spell slot of the spellâ€™s circle or higher. You don't need to prepare spells ahead of time.</p><p>The <strong>Paladin Progression</strong> table shows how many spells you know and how many Divine spell slots you have at a given level. For example, at 5th level, you have four 1st- circle slots and two 2nd-circle slots. If you know the 1st- circle spell bless and have a 1st-circle and a 2nd-circle spell slot available, you can cast bless using either slot. If you use a 1st-circle slot, you have three 1st-circle slots remaining.</p><p>You regain all used spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><h6>Spells Known of 1st Circle or Higher</h6><p>At 2nd level, choose two 1st-circle spells from the Divine spell list to learn.</p><p>The Spells Known column of the <strong>Paladin Progression</strong> table shows when you learn additional Divine spells. Each spell you choose must be from a circle for which you have Divine spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level as a paladin, you can learn one new Divine spell from the 1st or 2nd circle.</p><p>In addition, when you gain a level of paladin, you can choose one Divine spell you know and replace it with another spell of your choice from the Divine spell list. The replacement spell must be of a circle for which you have Divine spell slots.</p><h6>Spellcsating Ability</h6><p>Charisma (CHA) is your spellcasting ability. Your CHA modifier determines the save DC or the attack modifier for certain spells you cast:</p><p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus (PB) + your CHA modifier</p><p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus (PB) + your CHA modifier</p><h6>Spellcasting Focus</h6><p>You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your Divine spells.</p>",
