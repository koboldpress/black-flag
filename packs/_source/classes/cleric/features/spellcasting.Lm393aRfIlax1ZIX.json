      "value": "<p>As a conduit for divine power, you can cast Divine spells.</p><h6>Cantrips</h6><p>At 1st level, choose three cantrips from the Divine spell list to learn. You choose more Divine cantrips to learn at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the <strong>Cleric Progression</strong> table.</p><h6>Preparing Spells</h6><p>You must prepare spells in advance before you can cast them. You can prepare any spell on the Divine spell list from circles for which you have Divine spell slots. (You determine which spell slots you can access by checking your level on the Cleric Progression table). You can choose a number of spells equal to your WIS modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). This is your list of prepared spells from which you can cast.</p><p>Preparing a new list of spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell circle for each spell you change. You can change your list of prepared spells as part of a long rest.</p><h6>Casting Spells</h6><p>You have prepared a number of spells and can cast any of them by using a Divine spell slot of the spell’s circle or higher.</p><p>The <strong>Cleric Progression</strong> table shows how many Divine spell slots you have at a given level. For example, at 3rd level, you have four 1st-circle and two 2nd-circle spell slots, and with a 16 WIS, you can have six prepared spells of 1st or 2nd circle, in any combination. You only have two spell slots for 2nd-circle spells though, so if you prepare only 2nd-circle spells, you won’t be able to use your 1st-circle spell slots at all.</p><p>Casting a spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells, it just uses up a spell slot. You regain all used spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><h6>Spellcasting Ability</h6><p>Wisdom (WIS) is your spellcasting ability. Your WIS modifier determines the save DC and the attack modifier for certain spells you cast:</p><p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus (PB) + your WIS modifier</p><p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus (PB) + your WIS modifier</p><h6>Ritual Casting</h6><p>You can also cast a type of long-form spell called a ritual. Rituals don’t need to be prepared, and they don’t use up spell slots.</p><p>At 1st level, choose one ritual from the Divine ritual list. You learn more rituals at higher levels, as shown in the Rituals Known column of the Cleric Progression table, but only from a circle for which you have spell slots. Rituals you learn don't count against the number of spells you learn at each level.</p><h6>Spellcasting Focus</h6><p>You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your Divine spells.</p>",
