Each Fiend and Undead of your choice within 30 feet of you and that can see or hear you must make a [[/save wisdom dc=@abilities.wis.dc]]{WIS} save. If the creature fails its save, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.</p><p>A turned creature must try to move as far away from you as it can, though it can’t first get closer to you to do it. On its turn, it can use only the Dash action or otherwise try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, it can use the Dodge action. It can’t take any reactions.</p>",
