For example, a druid that hails from a desert environment is unlikely to be familiar enough with a sea-dwelling creature like a dolphin to select it as a known form. The Beast you choose canâ€™t have any legendary actions or lair actions.</p><p>As you advance in druid levels, you can choose more beast forms as shown in the Beast Forms Known column of the <strong>Druid Progression</strong> table.</p><p>When you gain a level of druid, you can replace one known form with a different form of your choosing.
