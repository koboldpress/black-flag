      "value": "<p>Your continued practice of spellcraft has honed your mind, allowing you to affix a limited number of spells—called rote spells—in your mind. Choose one 1st-circle Arcane spell from your spellbook, and that spell is now a rote spell. You always have a rote spell prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare during a long rest. Casting a rote spell still uses a spell slot as normal.</p><p>Over the course of 8 hours or as part of a long rest, you can exchange one rote spell for a different Arcane spell of the same circle contained in your spellbook.</p><p>At higher levels, you can select more rote spells: you choose a 2nd-circle Arcane spell to become a rote spell at 9th level, a 3rd-circle Arcane spell at 13th, and a 4th-circle Arcane spell at 17th.</p>",
