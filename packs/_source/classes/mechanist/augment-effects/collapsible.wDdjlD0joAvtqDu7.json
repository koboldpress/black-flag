While you touch the item, you can use an action to reduce its size. When you do so, the target is halved in all dimensions, its weight is reduced to 1/8 of normal, and it decreases its size category by one, such as from Medium to Small. The target’s size can’t be reduced further by multiple uses of this feature. As an action, you can touch the target and cause it to return to its original size.</p><p><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> Once you reach 9th level in the mechanist class, you can affect Huge or smaller items that meet the other requirements.</p>",
