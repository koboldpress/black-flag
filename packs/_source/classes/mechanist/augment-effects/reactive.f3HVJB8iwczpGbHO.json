      "value": "<p><em>Item Requirement: Large or Smaller Item that Isn’t Being Worn, Held, or Fixed in Place</em></p><p>You imbue an item with the ability to detect specific triggers and react in one of several ways. While you touch the item, you can use an action to set or change the item’s trigger and reaction.</p><p>You can set the item to trigger when a creature you specify comes within 30 feet of it. This can be a specific creature you have met, such as <q>Jon the messenger,</q> a general visual description, such as <q>anyone wearing a city watch uniform,</q> or a creature type, such as <q>Celestials.</q> Your GM has final say on what is reasonable for a trigger.</p><p>When triggered, you instantly become mentally aware that the item has been triggered, and the item can react in one of the following ways. At your GM’s discretion, an item might be able to react in other comparable ways:</p><p><strong>Recording.</strong> The item begins to record everything it can <q>see</q> and <q>hear</q> within 60 feet of it for the next hour, perceiving as a creature with typical vision or hearing could. After 1 hour, the item ceases to record new information and stores the recording until the item is no longer augmented or until you use an action to set a new trigger or reaction. While a recording is stored, you or any creature of your choosing can touch the item to mentally see and hear anything contained in the recording.</p><p><strong>Sound.</strong> The item emits a sound for up to 1 minute that can be heard to a range of 60 feet (you choose quality and range), such as the sound of ringing bells or a set of bird calls. Alternatively, you can cause it to emit a pre-determined message of 25 words or less in your own voice.</p><p><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> Once you reach 9th level in the mechanist class, the item can react when a specified creature comes within 60 feet of it.</p>",
