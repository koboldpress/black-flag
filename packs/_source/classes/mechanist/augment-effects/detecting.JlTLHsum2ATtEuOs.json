      "value": "<p><em>Item Requirement: Goggles, Glasses, Spyglass, or Similar Equipment or Object with a Transparent Surface</em></p><p>You imbue an item with magical capabilities to enhance perception. While you touch the item, you can use an action to activate one of the listed effects. You must equip, wear, or actively look through the augmented item to gain the benefit of the chosen effect:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Darkvision.</strong> You gain darkvision out to a range of 30 feet.</p></li><li><p><strong>Invisi-Vision.</strong> You can see invisible creatures and items as if they were visible. You are also aware of any creatures within 30 feet of you or if any creatures come within 30 feet of you, regardless of lighting conditions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Magic Vision.</strong> You gain the benefits of the detect magic spell within 30 feet of you.</p></li><li><p><strong>X-Ray Vision.</strong> You gain the ability to see through solid material within 30 feet of you. To you, solid items within that radius appear transparent and don’t prevent light from passing through them. The vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker substances block your vision, as does a thin sheet of lead.</p></li></ul><p>While the augmented item is activated, you can use an action to deactivate it or switch the type of vision the item bestows. You can keep the item activated for up to 1 minute, all at once or in several shorter spans, each one using a minimum of 6 seconds (1 round) from the duration. The effect fully recharges when you finish a long rest.</p><p><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> Once you reach 9th level in the mechanist class, the range of all vision effects increases to 60 feet.</p>",
