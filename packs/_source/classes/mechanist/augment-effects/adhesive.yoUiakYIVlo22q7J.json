While the item is within 30 feet of you, you can use an action to speak a command word and affix the item to a solid surface it is touching. The chosen surface can’t be part of a creature.</p><p>While affixed, the item can support up to 1,000 pounds of weight. If additional weight is added, the item detaches from the surface (falling or moving as appropriate).</p><p>A creature can spend an action to attempt to remove the affixed item with a [[/check strength athletics dc=@abilities.intelligence.dc]]{STR (Athletics)} check. The DC for this check equals 8 + your PB + your INT modifier. If a creature succeeds on this check, the item detaches from the surface.</p><p>If the item isn’t forcefully detached, it remains attached for 24 hours or until you use an action to detach it. If the item is detached by any means, its adhesive properties can’t be activated again until you finish a long rest.</p>",
