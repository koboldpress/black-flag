      "value": "<p>At 2nd level, you enhance your martial prowess with the ability to cast Primordial spells.</p><h6>Casting Spells</h6><p>You know a small number of spells and can cast any of them by using a Primordial spell slot of the spellâ€™s circle or higher. You don't need to prepare spells ahead of time.</p><p>The <strong>Ranger Progression</strong> table shows how many spells you know and how many Primordial spell slots you have at a given level. For example, at 5th level, you have four 1st-circle slots and two 2nd-circle slots. If you know the 1st-circle spell animal friendship and have a 1st-circle and a 2nd-circle spell slot available, you can cast animal friendship using either slot. If you use a 1st-circle slot, you have three 1st-circle slots remaining.</p><p>You regain all used spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><h6>Spells Known of 1st Circle and Higher</h6><p>At 2nd level, choose two 1st-circle spells from the Primordial spell list that you know.</p><p>The Spells Known column of the <strong>Ranger Progression</strong> table shows when you learn additional Primordial spells. Each spell you choose must be from a circle for which you have Primordial spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level as a ranger, you can learn one new Primordial spell from the 1st or 2nd circle.</p><p>In addition, when you gain a level of ranger, you can choose one Primordial spell you know and replace it with another spell of your choice from the Primordial spell list. The replacement spell must be of a circle for which you have Primordial spell slots.</p><h6>Spellcasting Ability</h6><p>Wisdom (WIS) is your spellcasting ability. Your WIS modifier determines the save DC or the attack modifier for certain spells you cast:</p><p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus (PB) + your WIS modifier</p><p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus (PB) + your WIS modifier</p><h6>Spellcasting Focus</h6><p>You can use a druidic focus as a spellcasting focus for your Primordial spells.</p>",
